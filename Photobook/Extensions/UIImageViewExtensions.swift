    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - asset: The Asset to use to get the image from
    ///   - size: Request a specific size from the asset. If nil the imageView's frame size will be used
    ///   - validCellCheck: Called after the image has been fetched, but doesn't wait for the fade animation to complete. The completion handler returns a Bool indicating if we're allowed to continue. A typical example where it will be false is if we are in a reusable view (cell) which has been recycled.
